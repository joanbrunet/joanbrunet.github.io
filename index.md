# About

  I am an Investigo research assistant at [CÃ¡tedra LiderazgoS y Sostenibilidad](https://www.esade.edu/faculty-research/es/catedra-liderazgos-y-sostenibilidad) at ESADE Research in Barcelona. During the summer of 2023 I held a position as a research assistant at the [Climate and Environment group in the Johns Hopkins University - Pompeu Fabra University (JHU-UPF) Public Policy Center](https://www.upf.edu/web/jhu-ppc/climate). My academic background includes a master's degree in [Current Democracies: Nationalism, Federalism, and Multiculturalism](https://www.upf.edu/web/masters/master-en-democracies-actuals-nacionalisme-federalisme-i-multiculturalitat) from Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. For my master's thesis, titled "Shattered Masks: Interrogating the Politics of Recognition through the European Roma community," I delved into issues of identity and oppression. Prior to this, I pursued [postgraduate studies as a data analyst](https://www.ub.edu/analista-de-dades/) at Barcelona University and obtained a bachelor's degree in [Political Science and Public Administration](https://www.uab.cat/web/estudiar/ehea-degrees/general-information-1216708259085.html?param1=1228291015798) from the Autonomous University of Barcelona.

  Throughout research journey, I have navigated at the intersection of political and data science, exploring multifaceted issues ranging from identity politics to environmental concerns. In both my positions at JHU-UPF and ESADE, I have deeply engaged with this intersection. This dynamic combination of political science and data-driven methodologies has been at the core of my academic and professional pursuits.


  On a personal level, I have a profound interest in electronic and ambient music.
