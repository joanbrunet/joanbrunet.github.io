# About

  I am a researcher focused on the political economy of sustainability and climate governance, with particular interest in how financial and policy mechanisms shape responses to environmental and social crises. I am currently seeking PhD positions in political economy and governance studies.

  My academic background includes a [Master's degree in Governance](https://www.upf.edu/web/masters/master-en-democracies-actuals-nacionalisme-federalisme-i-multiculturalitat) from Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, [postgraduate studies in data analysis for political analysis and public management](https://www.ub.edu/analista-de-dades/) from Barcelona University and a [bachelor's degree in Political Science and Public Administration](https://www.uab.cat/web/estudiar/ehea-degrees/general-information-1216708259085.html?param1=1228291015798) from the Autonomous University of Barcelona.

Most recently, I worked as a researcher at the [Center for Leadership and Sustainability at ESADE](https://www.esade.edu/faculty-research/es/catedra-liderazgos-y-sostenibilidad) in Barcelona (2023-2025), where I analyzed corporate sustainability practices and their relationship to broader governance frameworks. I examined how companies translate environmental and social commitments into practice, combining qualitative research with data analysis. Previously, in 2023, I held a research assistant position at the [Climate and Environment group in the Johns Hopkins University - Pompeu Fabra University (JHU-UPF) Public Policy Center](https://www.upf.edu/web/jhu-ppc/climate), working on environmental policy and data management.

Throughout my research, I have worked at the intersection of political economy, governance, and environmental policy, using both theoretical and empirical approaches.

On a personal level, I am interested in electronic and ambient music.

If of any interest, [here](assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf) is my CV.
