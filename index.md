# About

  I am an external research assistant at CÃ¡tedra LiderazgoS y Sostenibilidad at ESADE Research in Barcelona. Additionally, I also hold a position as a research assistant at the Climate and Environment group in the Johns Hopkins University - Pompeu Fabra University (JHU-UPF) Public Policy Center. My academic background includes a master's degree in Current Democracies: Nationalism, Federalism, and Multiculturalism from Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. For my master's thesis, titled "Shattered Masks: Interrogating the Politics of Recognition through the European Roma community," I delved into issues of identity and oppression. Prior to this, I pursued postgraduate studies as a data analyst at Barcelona University and obtained a bachelor's degree in Political Science and Public Administration from the Autonomous University of Barcelona.

  Throughout research journey, I have navigated at the intersection of political and data science, exploring multifaceted issues ranging from identity politics to environmental concerns. In both my positions at JHU-UPF and ESADE, I have deeply engaged with this intersection. This dynamic combination of political science and data-driven methodologies has been at the core of my academic and professional pursuits.


  On a personal level, I have a profound interest in electronic and ambient music.
